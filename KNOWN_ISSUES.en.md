### BUG-AS-08: ⚠ The gateway does not back up the instrument's factory DSP tuning

**Status:** limitation by design + warning (not a gateway-firmware bug).

The "Atom Spectra" instrument stores its pulse-processing tuning (DSP tuning) **inside
itself**: pulse-shape thresholds `RISE` / `FALL` / `NOISE`, `MAX` / `HYST` / `MODE` /
`STEP`, the sampling frequency `F`, the hardware HV/gain potentiometers `POT` / `POT2`,
the pile-up table and the thermal compensation.

Most of these values are visible in the instrument's reply to the `-inf` command —
including the pile-up table (`PileUp […]` / `PileUpThr`) and the **MAX** thermal-
compensation table (`Tco […]`). **However, the baseline thermal-compensation table**
(`POT2` / `V` versus temperature, the `-t_pot` points) **is NOT returned by `-inf`** —
only the `TCpot ON/OFF` flag is present there. The full baseline thermal-compensation
snapshot is given by the separate **`-tc_pot?`** command.

**What was observed.** A case was recorded where this entire tuning **reset to zero**:
`-inf` started returning `RISE 0 FALL 0 NOISE 0 F 1.00 MAX 0 HYST 0 ... POT 0 POT2 0`,
while the instrument itself stayed online and still answered `VERSION`. With zero
thresholds the instrument physically cannot discriminate pulses — counting stops
(`total_counts = 0`, `cps = 0`) even though the USB/CDC link is fine. **Re-plugging USB
does NOT restore the tuning.**

**Impact:** until the DSP tuning is restored the instrument acquires no spectrum (zero
counts). The gateway, WiFi, Web UI, TCP bridge, and the **energy calibration** (the
`E(ch)` polynomial, stored on the gateway in `calib.bin`) are **not affected** — this is
a state of the instrument itself, not of the gateway firmware.

**⚠ Warning — do NOT restore "blind" with tuning commands.**
Although the instrument protocol has configuration commands (`-ris`, `-fall`, `-nos`,
`-max`, `-hyst`, `-U`, `-V`, `-step`, etc.), **you must not write them at random**:
- `POT` / `POT2` are hardware HV/gain potentiometers, **specific to each individual**
  detector. Values from another unit (including examples in documentation) can set the
  wrong bias/gain and damage the instrument.
- Only the factory calibration procedure for that specific unit knows the correct
  thresholds and HV.

**Workaround / recovery:** contact the **instrument's manufacturer (KB Radar)** —
restoring the factory detector profile is done by the manufacturer. Do not try to write
the tuning parameters yourself "blind" (see the warning above).

**Recommendation going forward:** the gateway can **read** `-inf` (it shows the fields in
the Web UI) but does not back them up. While the instrument is correctly tuned it is worth
saving **two** of its replies once, as a reference "snapshot" of the DSP configuration:

1. the reply to **`-inf`** — the main thresholds, `POT` / `POT2`, the MAX thermal-
   compensation table (`Tco […]`) and pile-up;
2. the reply to **`-tc_pot?`** — the baseline thermal-compensation table (`POT2` / `V`
   versus temperature); **it is not present in `-inf`** (see above).

Then a future reset can be detected and both snapshots handed to the manufacturer
(KB Radar) as a reference of the factory tuning.

### BUG-AS-03: Serial number is not read

**Status:** open

The instrument serial number (`serial_number`) stays empty after connection.

**Cause:** in response to the `-inf` command the instrument returns fewer than 40 text lines. The code expects the serial number on line 39 (`process_info_response`), but the actual response is shorter. The calibration (lines 0–10) is read correctly; the serial number is not.

**Impact:** in the Web UI and the XML / CSV export the serial number field is empty. Spectrometer functionality is not affected.

**Workaround:** the serial number can be set manually via the Web UI (calibration panel).

## Fixed

### #WF-1: The device crash-looped while waterfall recording was active

**Status:** fixed in [`33fb4a4`](https://github.com/VibeEngineering-LLC/atomspectra-waterfall-esp32/commit/33fb4a4) (+ [`2b36737`](https://github.com/VibeEngineering-LLC/atomspectra-waterfall-esp32/commit/2b36737)), in `main`.

Under load from active waterfall recording (writing `.aswf` segments + simultaneous USB
intake from the detector + WiFi polling), the device crash-looped — rebooting roughly
every ~15 minutes.

**Cause:** `CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_AUTO_SUSPEND` was enabled on a flash chip not on the
ESP-IDF whitelist for that option — under concurrent load the SPI flash entered
auto-suspend at an inopportune moment during a write, causing a crash.

**Fix:** `CONFIG_SPI_FLASH_AUTO_SUSPEND` was disabled.

**Verification (#STAB-2, 2026-07-04):** a 9.40 h continuous board-path waterfall
recording retest (not an emulation) — **0 reboots, 0 dropped flash segments**
(`seg_dropped`) over the whole run, 52 clean `SEG_ROLLOVER` events. Before the fix — a
reboot every ~15 min under the same load. Full report with telemetry and charts:
[`docs/stab2_report.md`](docs/stab2_report.md) ([web version with charts](docs/stab2_report.html)).

### BUG-AS-07: Build fails on a clean clone — undefined `spectrogram_is_recording`

**Status:** fixed in [`1b21d61`](https://github.com/VibeEngineering-LLC/atomspectra-waterfall-esp32/commit/1b21d61)

The GitHub Actions `build` job (ESP-IDF v5.4) failed on a clean clone of the repository
within ~2 minutes. Local builds passed — the bug only showed up on a fresh clone (CI, a
different machine).

**Cause:** an **unfinished fragment** of the USB reconnect logic leaked into the public
repository. In `main/usb_host_cdc.c` (after the CDC link to the device was restored)
there was a call to `spectrogram_is_recording()` — to resume spectrum acquisition with
the `-sta` command if waterfall recording was active. That function is defined in the
waterfall recording subsystem files, which were **not committed** at the time of that
commit (the feature was unfinished local work). On the author's machine everything
compiled because the definition was in the working copy; on a clean clone the compiler
saw only the call with no declaration → `implicit declaration of function
'spectrogram_is_recording'`. ESP-IDF builds with `-Werror=all`, so an implicit
declaration is a hard build error, not a warning.

**Fix:** the unfinished recording-resume hook was removed from `usb_host_cdc.c` in the
public repository — the build again depends only on committed symbols. The
auto-resume-on-reconnect feature itself stays in an unpublished local branch and will
land as a single coherent commit together with the whole stream-to-disk recording
subsystem (not as a lone dangling call).

**Update:** the promised single commit has landed — the autonomous segment-recording
subsystem (`spectrogram.[ch]`, the `/segments` and `/segment` endpoints, the reconnect
hook in `usb_host_cdc.c`, auto-resume via `spectrogram_restore()`) is published as a
whole in the `rec-11-autonomous-recording` branch. A clean-clone build is self-contained
again — `spectrogram_is_recording()` is now defined within the same commit as its call.

**Verification:** the CI `build` job on commit `1b21d61` is green (the prior `b0b8856`
and `958ac19` failed with the same `implicit declaration`). Prevention going forward:
before pushing, verify the branch "as a clean clone" — build from committed files only,
not from a working copy that has uncommitted changes.

### BUG-AS-06: Waterfall stream-to-disk recording stops on its own

**Status:** fixed (see `web/waterfall.html`, write serializer `dskEnqueue`)

While recording the waterfall to a file ("💾 Stream to disk", `.aswf` format via the
browser File System Access API) the recording would stop on its own after a while —
the recording indicator went off and the file stopped growing, even though the
WebSocket stream kept arriving. It reproduced more reliably the more frequently rows
arrived (smaller waterfall interval); at larger intervals it happened less often but
still systematically.

**Cause:** incoming WS rows were written to the `FileSystemWritableFileStream` with
`dskWritable.write(...)` **without `await`**, while every 30 seconds the
`flushDiskHeader` timer rewrote the file header (several more `write()` calls).
`FileSystemWritableFileStream.write()` is asynchronous: starting a new write while a
previous one is still pending throws **synchronously** (the stream is locked,
`The stream is locked`). At the "data-row write ↔ header rewrite" boundary the
exception occurred systematically (roughly every 30 seconds); it was caught by the
write error handler, which called `stopDiskStream()` — so the recording disabled
itself.

**Fix:** all writes to the stream are serialized through a single Promise queue
(`dskEnqueue`) — the next write starts only after the previous one completes, never
two concurrent `write()` calls. Write positions use explicit byte offsets
(`{type:"write",position:…}`) instead of the implicit cursor: the header (positions 0
and 8) and the data rows (position ≥ `8 + header reserve`) no longer overlap.
`stopDiskStream()` drains the queue (`await dskQueue`) before the final header write
and `close()`; a reentrancy guard `dskStopping` was added.

**Verification:** firmware build (ESP-IDF v5.4) with no errors; `node --check` of the
embedded JS — no syntax errors; the change is mirrored into the demo
(`demo/waterfall.html`). On-device functional test: waterfall recording at a 5 s
interval (rows arrive more often than the 30 s header flush fires) — the recording
keeps running without self-disabling.

### BUG-AS-05: Web UI breaks on repeated Ctrl+F5 (HTTP 431)

**Status:** fixed (see `sdkconfig.defaults`, key `CONFIG_HTTPD_MAX_REQ_HDR_LEN`)

On repeated hard reload (Ctrl+F5) of the waterfall page the UI could break — some
assets failed to load, charts/stream stopped updating.

**Cause:** on a hard reload the browser bypasses the cache and sends a request with
the full set of HTTP headers (`Authorization: Basic` from web-auth + `Sec-Fetch-*` +
`Accept*` + `Cache-Control: no-cache`). The combined header block exceeded the
ESP-IDF httpd limit `CONFIG_HTTPD_MAX_REQ_HDR_LEN` (default **512 B**), so the server
replied `431 Request Header Fields Too Large` instead of the page. The firmware stayed
fully stable throughout (heap/CPU unchanged, no reboots) — only the browser UI broke.

**Fix:** httpd limits raised in `sdkconfig.defaults`:
`CONFIG_HTTPD_MAX_REQ_HDR_LEN=1024` and `CONFIG_HTTPD_MAX_URI_LEN=1024` (512 → 1024 B).

**Verification:** Ctrl+F5 stress test with UART capture — after the fix the `431`
responses are gone (was: on every F5 → now: 0), no firmware reboots, WS reconnects
succeed. Method and raw before/after logs: [`tests/stress/`](tests/stress/README.md).

### BUG-AS-04: Calibration missing from XML after reboot

**Status:** fixed in [`3ab490f`](https://github.com/VibeEngineering-LLC/atomspectra-esp32/commit/3ab490f)

After an ESP32 reboot, calibration could be missing from the JSON API and XML export despite a saved `calib.bin`.

**Cause:** in `main.c` the call to `spectrum_load_calibration()` came **before** `spectrum_restore_autosave()`. The autosave restored the full `s_spectrum` structure via `fread()`, overwriting the calibration loaded from `calib.bin`.

**Fix:** the call order in `app_main()` was changed — first `spectrum_restore_autosave()`, then `spectrum_load_calibration()`.

### BUG-AS-02: keV cursor shows the wrong energy

**Status:** fixed in [`a9dab5e`](https://github.com/VibeEngineering-LLC/atomspectra-esp32/commit/a9dab5e)

When hovering the cursor over the spectrum, the keV value did not match the real channel energy.

**Cause:** in the Web UI the energy calculation applied the polynomial coefficients incorrectly — the coefficient order was inverted (the BecqMoni UI shows coefficients in descending order: a=ch⁴, b=ch³, …, e=offset, while the internal format is ascending: c₀=offset, c₁=ch¹, …).

**Fix:** the `channelToKeV()` function in `index.html` recomputes using the ascending polynomial `E(ch) = c₀ + c₁·ch + c₂·ch² + c₃·ch³ + c₄·ch⁴`.

### BUG-AS-01: Web UI — labels and logarithmic scale

**Status:** fixed in [`a9dab5e`](https://github.com/VibeEngineering-LLC/atomspectra-esp32/commit/a9dab5e)

- The logarithmic Y scale rendered incorrectly (zero channels produced -Infinity)
- The device name was displayed as "Atom Spectra" instead of the real one from the instrument

**Fix:** a full Web UI rework — protected `Math.log10()` against zeros, correct device name.

### calibEditing: Calibration fields overwritten while editing

**Status:** fixed in [`7cf0beb`](https://github.com/VibeEngineering-LLC/atomspectra-esp32/commit/7cf0beb)

While manually entering calibration coefficients via the Web UI, the `update()` loop (once per second) overwrote the field contents with the current values from the API.

**Fix:** a `calibEditing` flag was added — while the user edits the form, auto-refresh of the calibration fields is paused.

## Limitations

### Flash memory: wear from autosave

Autosave of the current spectrum (`current.bin`, ~33 KB) runs every 60 seconds. That is ~1440 writes per day.

| Flash type | Endurance | Estimated lifetime |
|---|---|---|
| Winbond (typical, 100K cycles) | 100,000 erases/sector | **15–30 years** |
| Cheap no-name (10K cycles) | 10,000 erases/sector | **1.5–5 years** |

LittleFS uses copy-on-write and wear leveling across the whole partition (12.9 MB), which spreads the load. With original ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 boards using Winbond flash, no issues are expected.

**Possible optimizations** (not implemented, not needed at current lifetimes):
- Increase the autosave interval (e.g. 5 minutes)
- Save only when the spectrum changes (delta check)
- Keep in PSRAM, write to flash only on a clean shutdown

### Single TCP client

The TCP bridge (port 8234) supports **one** simultaneous connection. A second connection attempt is rejected. BecqMoni or AtomSpectra on a PC works until a second instance opens.

### ESP32 supports WiFi 2.4 GHz only

5 GHz networks are not supported in hardware. Make sure the router broadcasts on 2.4 GHz.

### Maximum channels — 8192

The Atom Spectra instrument transmits 8192 channels. This is a hardware limitation of the spectrometer, not the firmware.

### Autonomous recording: keep-last ring on flash-full has not had a long soak

**Context:** the feature + the #WF-1 fix (`33fb4a4`) are already in `main`; the
`rec-11-autonomous-recording` branch as a whole is not merged yet (extra unrelated commits on top).

Autonomous segment recording (`seg_NNNNN.aswf`) and segment rotation when
`WF_SEG_MAX_ROWS` (64 rows) is reached are **confirmed** on the device: `seg_00000.aswf`
finalizes when full and `seg_00001.aswf` is created automatically.

The **keep-last ring** mode (on flash-full the oldest not-yet-offloaded segment is
overwritten; counters `seg_count` / `seg_dropped`) is implemented but **has not been
verified by a long soak** up to actual partition exhaustion (≈763 rows, ≈5 days at a
10-min interval). Until that test passes, the "flash full → overwrite oldest" boundary is
considered untested — that specific scenario (real partition exhaustion) hasn't been run yet,
though the recording code itself is already in `main`.

**Update 2026-07-04 (#STAB-2):** a 9.40 h board-path soak test confirmed the reliability
of the segment writes themselves — **0 reboots, 0 `seg_dropped`**, 52 clean
`SEG_ROLLOVER` events (see the #WF-1 fix above). This is not the same test as a soak to
actual exhaustion of the 763-row partition (the segment keep-last ring still has not been
run to real overflow) — but a **separate** export limitation was found along the way: the
`ring_capacity` field in `/api/waterfall/status` is fixed at **256 rows** (~4.25 h at a
~60 s cadence) — smaller than the ~763-row partition-capacity estimate above. n42 exports
of recordings longer than ~4.25 h come out truncated (see #FW-19 below). Full writeup:
[`docs/stab2_report.md`](docs/stab2_report.md) §6.

### #FW-19: n42 export truncated by the flash-ring capacity (256 rows ≈ 4.25 h)

**Status:** open (task #32).

When exporting to n42 a recording that ran longer than ~4.25 h, the file contains only
the **last 256 rows** — regardless of how many rows were actually recorded
(`total_rows`). Cause: `ring_capacity=256` (`/api/waterfall/status`) — the ring
physically holds only the last 256 rows; older ones get overwritten by new ones before
the export is pulled.

This is **not a #WF-1 regression** — the `seg_dropped` counter (write losses) stays at 0,
i.e. the write path itself loses no data; the limitation is in the exported ring's
storage size, not write reliability. The `RING_OVERFLOW` event does not detect the
overwrite itself (its condition is the write-lag `total_rows − flash_rows ≥
ring_capacity`, not the wraparound fact).

**Workaround:** for recordings longer than ~4.25 h, periodically pull segments via
`/api/waterfall/segment` (see [`WATERFALL.en.md`](WATERFALL.en.md#autonomous-segment-recording-rec-11-a1))
instead of waiting until the end of the recording for a single export. Details and the
telemetry from the test that found this: [`docs/stab2_report.md`](docs/stab2_report.md) §6.

### Pull polling (`wf_pull_client.py`, #REC-12): no pin against the keep-last ring

The keep-last ring (`make_room()`, `main/spectrogram.c:304-321`) deletes the oldest
FINALIZED segment when Flash space is short — except the currently open segment and any
**pinned** one (`s_seg_pinned`). Only the push offload path (#REC-11-A2, `wf_offload.c`)
pins a segment; the pull path (`GET /api/waterfall/segment`, `main/web_waterfall.c:468`)
does **not** pin the segment while it downloads it.

If the PC client polls SLOWER than the board fills Flash with unread segments, the ring
can delete a segment before `wf_pull_client.py` gets a chance to fetch it. The next
`GET .../segment?name=...` then fails (`error:get:...` in the client log), no delete/ack
is sent, but the segment is already physically gone — the data is lost for good, leaving
a hole in the stitched `.aswf`. This is NOT detected as a "board pause" (the `gap` check
in `wf_pull_client.py:161-169` only catches recording pauses, not segments the ring ate).

**Workaround:** keep the client's `--interval` well below the time it takes the ring to
eat an unread segment at the current recording rate. There is currently no automatic
protection (a pin, like push has) for the pull download path — not implemented.
