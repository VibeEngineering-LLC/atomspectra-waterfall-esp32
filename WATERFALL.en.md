# Waterfall (spectrogram) — accumulate, stream to PC, export

[🇷🇺 Русская версия](WATERFALL.md) · [← README](README.en.md)

The gateway can accumulate a **waterfall** (spectrogram): a sequence of spectra
taken at fixed intervals. Each waterfall row is a **delta** of the cumulative
spectrum over one interval — i.e. a finished "counts-per-period" spectrum,
8192 channels, `uint16` per channel (**16 KB per row**).

You can:

- **record it to Flash autonomously as `.aswf` segments — no browser** (#REC-11-A1):
  press "Start", close the tab — the board keeps recording on its own and **survives a
  reboot / power loss** (see [Autonomous segment recording](#autonomous-segment-recording-rec-11-a1));
- view it right in the board's browser — `http://<board-ip>/waterfall`;
- **stream it to a PC live** over WebSocket;
- **pull finished `.aswf` segments over HTTP** (`/api/waterfall/segments` →
  `/api/waterfall/segment?name=…`) and stitch them on the PC / in the browser;
- **export it with the "⬇ Export .n42" button** right from the Web UI — the board
  builds **ANSI N42.42** from the PSRAM ring (works even without flash persistence);
- convert to **ANSI N42.42** with the scripts shipped in this repo;
- open it as a 2D waterfall in the offline viewer shipped in this repo.

> **mDNS.** The gateway announces itself as **`atomspectra.local`** (#REC-9) —
> everywhere below you may use `http://atomspectra.local/` instead of `<board-ip>`.

## What it looks like

Built-in waterfall Web UI (`http://<board-ip>/waterfall`): the spectrogram on top
(time flows downward, X axis is channels/energy), with a slice of the current
spectrum under the hovered row. Colour encodes intensity per the chosen palette and
scale (log/lin).

![Web UI — "Waterfall" tab (spectrogram + spectrum slice)](images/web-ui-waterfall.png)

> 🔴 **Live demo of this tab on real data** (no board required):
> **<https://vibeengineering-llc.github.io/atomspectra-waterfall-esp32/demo/waterfall.html>**

Buttons **Start / Stop / Clear / Export .n42**, an **Interval** field, a
**keep in Flash** checkbox, X-axis selector (channels/keV), brightness (log/lin),
palette, contrast slider and channel zoom. The counter shows total rows · in ring
(`149/256`) · in Flash.

### Spectrogram palettes

Row colour is set by the chosen **palette** (the selector button above the
spectrogram). **14** palettes are available; the choice is saved in the browser
(`localStorage`, key `aswf-pal`) and applied to the whole waterfall on the fly (the
palette is expanded into a 256-level LUT). Default is **Inferno**.

| Palette | Type | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **Inferno** | perceptual, warm | default, high contrast on dark background |
| **Magma** | perceptual, warm | softer than Inferno, purple-pink |
| **Plasma** | perceptual, warm | purple→yellow, no black |
| **Viridis** | perceptual, cool | colour-blind friendly |
| **Cividis** | perceptual, cool | optimised for colour-blindness |
| **Parula** | perceptual | MATLAB default palette |
| **Cubehelix** | monotone luminance | survives black-and-white printing |
| **Turbo** | rainbow | Jet replacement with even luminance |
| **Jet** | rainbow | MATLAB classic |
| **Spectral** | diverging | blue↔yellow↔red |
| **Hot** | thermal | black→red→yellow→white |
| **Ocean** | cool | black→blue→white, calm |
| **Cool** | vivid | cyan→magenta |
| **Grayscale** | mono | for printing |

> For quantitative reading prefer the perceptually-uniform palettes
> (Inferno/Magma/Plasma/Viridis/Cividis/Parula/Cubehelix/Turbo) — they don't create
> false intensity "bands". Jet and the other rainbow maps are for eye-candy only.

## How it works

| Parameter | Value | Where in code |
|---|---|---|
| Channels | 8192 (`WF_CHANNELS`) | `main/spectrogram.h` |
| Row size | 16 KB (`WF_ROW_BYTES`) | `main/spectrogram.h` |
| PSRAM ring | 256 rows × 16 KB = **4 MB** (`WF_RING_ROWS_DEFAULT`) | `main/spectrogram.h` |
| Default interval | 5 s (`WF_INTERVAL_DEFAULT`), range **5…3600** s (`WF_INTERVAL_MIN`/`WF_INTERVAL_MAX`) | `main/spectrogram.h` |
| Rows per segment | 64 (`WF_SEG_MAX_ROWS`) ≈ 1 MB payload | `main/spectrogram.h` |
| Segment finalised no later than | 10 min (`WF_SEG_MAX_AGE_SEC`) | `main/spectrogram.h` |
| Segment header reserve | 4096 B (`WF_HDR_RESERVE`), payload at offset 4104 (`WF_SEG_HEADER`) | `main/spectrogram.h` |
| Data type | `uint16` little-endian | `main/web_waterfall.c` |

While `recording`, rows accumulate into a **PSRAM ring buffer** (the latest 256 rows
are always available for the window/stream). If `persist` is on, rows are also written
to **flash** (LittleFS) — not as one file but as **segments** `.aswf` (see below): the
unit of upload, the unit of the keep-last ring, and an independent file for stitching.
When flash runs out of space the **keep-last ring** kicks in: the oldest not-yet-sent
segment is overwritten, `flash_full` becomes `true` (= ring is active), the `seg_dropped`
counter grows; the PSRAM ring and the WS stream keep running without interruption.

> **Calibration.** The instrument's real energy calibration is a 5-coefficient
> polynomial (`E(ch) = c₀ + c₁·ch + c₂·ch² + c₃·ch³ + c₄·ch⁴`). It is delivered in the
> **WebSocket text header** (`/ws/waterfall`) and in the `.aswf` file header — **not**
> in the `t1/t2/t3` fields of `/api/spectrum.json`. The tools in `scripts/` read the
> calibration from the WS header, so the axis comes out in **keV**.

## Autonomous segment recording (#REC-11-A1)

The key property: **recording happens on the board and does not depend on the browser.**
The browser is only needed to press "Start" (and later "Stop") — after start you can
close the tab, turn the PC off, and the board keeps recording on its own.

Once recording with `persist` is on, the board writes the waterfall to Flash as
**segments** `/storage/wf/seg_NNNNN.aswf` (monotonic index). Each segment is a
**standalone valid `.aswf`** (own header, own calibration, own `started_at`), so it can
be pulled and read independently of the others.

| Property | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Segment size | up to **64 rows** (`WF_SEG_MAX_ROWS`) ≈ 1 MB payload |
| Finalisation | on reaching 64 rows **OR** after 10 min (`WF_SEG_MAX_AGE_SEC`) — so a large interval doesn't leave a file open for hours |
| Survives reboot | on boot `spectrogram_restore()` reconciles `/storage/wf`: deletes empty stubs, restores the index; **if recording was active — continues into a NEW segment** (no mid-segment append, every file stays valid) |
| Flash full | **keep-last ring**: the oldest not-yet-sent segment is overwritten; `flash_full=true`, `seg_dropped` grows |
| Row counter | the header always carries `saved_rows=0` — **rows are derived from the file size** (`payload / row_stride`); the header is never patched (patching an offset in LittleFS = copy-on-write of the whole file tail with a multi-second flash-cache freeze) |
| Open segment | marked `finalized:false` in `/segments` (by the open file's index); no need to pull it before finalise |

Total storage capacity ≈ **763 rows**. At a 10-min interval that's ≈ **5.3 days** of
continuous recording, at a 1-hour interval ≈ **31 days** (before the keep-last ring
engages).

> **Stability (#STAB-2, 2026-07-04):** a 9.40 h board-path recording run — 0 reboots, 0
> `seg_dropped`, every `SEG_ROLLOVER` clean (see the #WF-1 fix in
> [`KNOWN_ISSUES.en.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.en.md)). Full report: [`docs/stab2_report.md`](docs/stab2_report.md).
>
> **⚠ #FW-19:** the n42 export only returns the last **256 rows** (~4.25 h at a ~60 s
> cadence) — a separate limit from the `ring_capacity` field (`/api/waterfall/status`),
> smaller than the ~763-row partition-capacity estimate above. For recordings longer than
> ~4.25 h, pull segments periodically via `/api/waterfall/segment` (see below) instead of
> waiting until the end of the recording. Details: [`docs/stab2_report.md`](docs/stab2_report.md)
> §6, [`KNOWN_ISSUES.en.md`](KNOWN_ISSUES.en.md) (#FW-19).

> Serving a segment (`/api/waterfall/segment?name=…`) is **strictly read-only**: the
> board never deletes the file. Deletion is only by the keep-last ring (or the future
> A2 uploader after a successful send). So a browser/receiver can never erase data that
> hasn't been stitched yet.

`GET /api/waterfall/status` → JSON:

```json
{
  "recording": false, "persist": false, "flash_full": false, "ready": true,
  "interval_sec": 5, "ring_capacity": 256, "ring_count": 0,
  "total_rows": 0, "flash_rows": 0,
  "seg_count": 0, "seg_dropped": 0,
  "started_at": 0, "channels": 8192
}
```

- `ready` — PSRAM ring allocated;
- `ring_count` — valid rows in the ring (≤ `ring_capacity`);
- `total_rows` — rows recorded since `start` (monotonic);
- `flash_rows` — rows written to flash this session (monotonic);
- `flash_full` — the **keep-last ring is active** (old segments being overwritten), not "flash is gone forever";
- `seg_count` — finalised segments currently on Flash;
- `seg_dropped` — segments removed by the keep-last ring since boot.

`GET /api/waterfall/segments` → JSON array (no CSRF). Each element:

```json
[ {"name":"seg_00000.aswf","idx":0,"bytes":1052680,"rows":64,"finalized":true} ]
```

- `rows` is derived from the file size: `(bytes − 4104) / 16384`;
- `finalized:false` — the segment is currently open — don't pull it;
- no directory yet / nothing recorded → `[]`.

## File formats

### ASWW — window snapshot (`/api/waterfall/window`)

Compact header-less binary, streamed out (single 16 KB bounce buffer, no second
4 MB buffer → no OOM):

```
"ASWW" (4 bytes)
channels     u32 LE   (= 8192)
rows         u32 LE   (rows in the window)
first_index  u32 LE   (total index of the first row)
interval     u32 LE   (seconds between rows)
payload      = rows × channels × uint16 LE   (chronological, oldest first)
```

### ASWF — self-describing file

Binary with a JSON header — everything needed to interpret it standalone. Common frame:

```
"ASWF" (4 bytes)
header_len   u32 LE          (JSON header length in bytes)
header       = JSON (utf-8), header_len bytes
payload      = rows × row-record   (v1: 16384 B; v2: row_stride B, see below)
```

`.aswf` is now written by **two** producers:

1. **PC script `scripts/waterfall_client.py`** from the WS stream (`/ws/waterfall`) —
   format **v1**: a row record is exactly `channels × uint16 LE` (16384 B),
   variable `header_len`, key `rows`:

   ```json
   {
     "format": "atomspectra-waterfall", "version": 1,
     "channels": 8192, "dtype": "uint16", "byte_order": "little",
     "rows": 1234, "interval_sec": 5, "started_at": 1750000000,
     "serial": "...", "calibration": [c0, c1, c2, c3, c4]
   }
   ```

2. **The firmware itself** — segments `/storage/wf/seg_NNNNN.aswf` (#REC-11-A1), format
   **v2**: after the 16384 B of spectrum each row carries **2 B of real duration**
   (`uint16 LE`, seconds of instrument live time) — a row record is **16386 B**.
   The header is self-describing: `row_stride` = record size, `row_time.offset` =
   duration offset within the record. `header_len` is **fixed = 4096**
   (`WF_HDR_RESERVE`; the JSON is space-padded, payload is always at offset **4104**),
   and the counters `saved_rows`/`saved_at` come **first, fixed-width** and are
   always written by the firmware as **zeros**: `saved_rows=0` means "derive the
   row count from the file size" (`(bytes − 4104) / row_stride`). The header is
   never modified after the segment is opened — patching an offset in LittleFS
   would mean copy-on-write of the whole file tail with a multi-second
   flash-cache freeze:

   ```json
   {"saved_rows":       0,"saved_at":          0,"format":"atomspectra-waterfall",
    "version":2,"channels":8192,"dtype":"uint16","byte_order":"little",
    "row_stride":16386,"row_time":{"dtype":"uint16","unit":"sec","offset":16384},
    "interval_sec":5,"started_at":1782741288,"serial":"...","calibration":[c0,c1,c2,c3,c4]}
   ```

A reader that takes `header_len` from `[4:8]`, parses that many JSON bytes (trailing
spaces are ignored) and steps through the payload with `row_stride` (defaulting to
`channels×2` when the field is absent) handles both variants correctly.
`serial`/`calibration` are present only if the instrument reported them. Files
saved by the viewer/browser carry the actual `saved_rows` — a reader must accept
both variants (0 = derive-from-size, >0 = authoritative value).

#### Per-row duration (`dur`) semantics and the timing model

Waterfall rows are closed by **instrument live time** (`total_time_sec` from STAT
packets), not by the ESP32 clock — so the file stays honest even under USB loss:

- **Nominal `dur = interval_sec`** — a regular row.
- **`dur = interval_sec + 1`** (rarely more) — a USB sweep was lost at the row
  boundary: its second honestly moves to the adjacent row, counts are never smeared.
  The `counts/dur` rate stays flat — which is exactly how files are validated
  (`scripts/fw8_boundary_check.py`).
- **`dur = 0` is never written.** Instrument goes silent (USB drops) → instrument
  time stands still → rows simply do not close, the waterfall pauses.
- Spectrum commit time is robust to STAT packet loss: every full sweep = exactly
  1 s of live time, every dropped sweep = 1 more second between commits; STAT is
  accepted no lower than this arithmetic (a rollback ≥5 s = instrument restart).
- Segment rollover has **no dead window**: the next segment's header is
  preallocated (`WF_HDR_RESERVE`), rows are written immediately, finalisation
  is just fsync+fclose (the header is never patched, #FW-14).

Rendering: a row's height (time) = its `dur`; for v1 — `interval_sec` from the header.

**`started_at` (segment anchor) — a DIFFERENT time source than `dur`.** Each
row's `dur` comes from the INSTRUMENT's own live clock (`total_time_sec`) and
never depends on internet access — the relative spacing between rows is always
honest. `started_at` in the segment header, on the other hand, is the board's
`time(NULL)` (ESP32 wall clock), synced via SNTP (`pool.ntp.org`, `init_sntp()`,
one outgoing request at boot, no retry/success check). **If the board never had
internet access, `time(NULL)` is unsynced and `started_at` sits near the Unix
epoch** (a real case with `started_at=1` has been observed). Autonomous
recording still works fine — only the ABSOLUTE time anchor is lost (the date in
the header / N42 export), the row durations (`dur`) stay real. The anchor is
re-captured on EVERY new segment — if internet appears mid-recording, segments
before and after get different (inconsistent) `started_at` values, and the jump
between them is NOT detected as a "board pause" (see `wf_pull_client.py`, gap
detection is explicitly disabled when `started_at ≤ 1e9`).

### WebSocket header (`/ws/waterfall`)

The first frame after connect is a **text** JSON:

```json
{ "type": "header", "channels": 8192, "interval_sec": 5, "total_rows": 187,
  "serial": "...", "calibration": [c0, c1, c2, c3, c4] }
```

Then one **binary** frame per new row (16384 bytes = 8192 × uint16 LE). Up to
4 WS clients are supported at once.

## Streaming to a PC and N42 export

`scripts/` ships a set of tools (require `pip install requests websocket-client`):

### `waterfall_n42.py` — export to ANSI N42.42-2012

ANSI N42.42 (IEC 62755) is the XML gamma-spectrometry interchange format understood by
InterSpec, PeakEasy, Cambio. Each waterfall row becomes one `<RadMeasurement>` with
`RealTimeDuration = PT{interval}S`; sparse delta rows are compressed with `CountedZeroes`.
The calibration is written to `<EnergyCalibration>` (polynomial from the WS header).

```bash
# board ring snapshot → snapshot.n42
python waterfall_n42.py window  <board-ip> -o snapshot.n42

# live stream to N42, auto-stop after 360 s (recording must be ON on the board)
python waterfall_n42.py stream  <board-ip> -o live.n42 --seconds 360

# convert a previously captured .aswf (pull calibration from the board via --host)
python waterfall_n42.py convert capture.aswf -o capture.n42 --host <board-ip>
```

Options: `--detector CsI|NaI|LaBr3|...` (default `CsI`), `-o/--out`.

### `waterfall_viewer.html` — offline waterfall viewer

A standalone HTML page (no server, no dependencies): open it in a browser and
**drag a `.n42` file** onto it — it renders a heatmap (time ↓ × energy →, viridis
palette). Controls: channel range, detail, log/contrast, hover tooltip with energy in
keV (when calibration is present). You can also pass a file via `?src=name.n42` when
serving over `http://`.

![Offline viewer waterfall_viewer.html — waterfall heatmap from .n42](images/waterfall-viewer.png)

A ready-made sample [`example-waterfall.n42`](scripts/example-waterfall.n42) (export of
a real run) ships with the repo — drag it into the viewer to see the result right away
without connecting to a board.

### `waterfall_client.py` — capture to `.aswf`

Writes an unbounded `.aswf` from the WS stream (not limited by the board's 256-row
ring). Stop with Ctrl+C — the header with the final row count is written on exit.
The `.aswf` can then be converted to N42 via `waterfall_n42.py convert`.

### `wf_pull_client.py` / `wf_recorder_app.py` — pull recording with on-the-fly stitching (#REC-12)

An alternative to `waterfall_client.py` aimed at **multi-hour/multi-day** recording without
holding a live WS connection: the script periodically polls `/api/waterfall/segments`,
pulls each **finalized** segment exactly once, appends its rows to a single growing
`.aswf`, and deletes the segment on the board only **after** the local file is fsynced —
so a dropped connection or crash mid-transfer never loses or duplicates rows. Progress
(which segments are already ingested, running row/duration totals) is tracked in a
sidecar `<file>.state.json` next to the `.aswf`, so stopping and re-running against the
same file **resumes** the recording instead of restarting it.

`wf_recorder_app.py` (launch by double-clicking `wf_recorder.bat`) is a desktop GUI
(tkinter) on top of the same logic: **▶ Start/⏸ Stop** buttons, **New file…** (stops the
current recording, lets you pick a new path, and wipes that path's `.aswf` +
`.state.json` + `.temps.csv` if they already exist — so you start from a genuinely clean
slate instead of resuming an old recording) and **Open folder**; it shows live counters
for rows in the file, duration, instrument temperature, and board segment counts.

```bash
python wf_pull_client.py <board-ip> --stitch capture.aswf --interval 60
```
